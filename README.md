## CRUD API Test

This project's frontend was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). The crud api is set using node, express and MongoDb - make sure you have MongoDb installed before running the project.

The steps to run the project:

- Go to the directory ft-crud-api
- Run `npm install` to install all the dependencies
- Run `npm start` to run the api on [http://localhost:4000/api/company](http://localhost:4000/api/company)

Other script available:

- `npm run serve` to start the crud api only on [http://localhost:4000/api/company](http://localhost:4000/api/company)
- `npm run test` for testing the crud api
